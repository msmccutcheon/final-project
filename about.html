              <p>So here is a little information on irritable bowel syndrome and how it effects me daily. I got diagnosed about 3 years ago, and it has been a ride ever since. I didn't know how to deal with it at all my first year so i spent alot of days in the hospital back and forth due to it being misdiagnosed also uncontrolled. On February 13th, 2019 i woke up to severe stomach pain, vomiting, could barely walk, and was very lathergic. I went to the hospital and after running tests and having x-rays done, they determined my small intestine was flipping itself inside & out. They wanted to do emergency surgery but i declined. I spent 10 days in the hosptial and from that day on i have been in and out of the hospital for the past 3 years. This year in 2022 has been a good year so far with the hosptial visits after learning how to keep my body calm during its flight or fight process.    </p>
